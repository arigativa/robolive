# This file defines where various build tools live and gets included
# in each of the makefiles. 
#
# The distribution ships with everything you need except for the Java 
# development kit (get this from www.javasoft.com) and cygwin if you are 
# under windows. You need cygwin for building it using the makefiles
# There are also several shell scriptsfor starting things up in various 
# places. No problem under unixen but for windows, you need to install 
# cygwin. 
#
# You can set the following variables here according to where you 
# have put things. These values are used in the makefiles.
